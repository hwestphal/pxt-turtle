## Which web sites do I need to unblock for @homeurl@? #unblock

* @homeurl@
* https://makecode.com

## Where are my projects saved?

Projects are kept in the browser's local indexed data store. You can save your project with a name. If you don't name your project, it's kept as an "Untitled" project. You can also save your project to a file or in the cloud.

Read more about [saving](/save) projects.

## Can I use MakeCode when I'm not connected to the internet? #work-offline

Yes, when MakeCode first loads in the browser, it tells the browser to download the files it needs to work locally. If you later want to add an extension to use with your program, you will need to connect again. See the page about using MakeCode [offline](/offline).

## What happens when I clear the browser's cache and temporary files? #clear-data

When you clear browsing data, all of the saved projects and files that support MakeCode working offline are removed. Any project that you've shared to the public cloud is still there.

## Where does a project that I share go? #sharing

When you share a project it's saved to the public cloud for MakeCode. Anyone can see your project if they have it's shared URL.

## What are some additional ways I can share projects with teachers and friends? #share-options

* Use the share button to publish your project to the MakeCode cloud. You can send the share URL that's created to anyone.
* The share URL can be pasted into a OneNote page or inserted as an embedded link on a website. In some cases, the link will be automatically expand into a read-only editor view of your project.
* You can save the project and copy it to a class website or to an approved location on the class or school network.
* You can copy code from and paste code into the JavaScript view of the editor. This let's you move code between MakeCode and other applications on your computer or device.

## Why does the editor still use the previous project name if I renamed the download file?

When you download the program for your project, the name you gave the project becomes part of the download file. If you decide to rename the download file, the name you chose for the project, not the current filename, is used and displayed by the editor.

## Where is the "Add Package" button?

Packages were renamed to **Extensions** to align with other code editors. You will now find the **Extensions** menu selection that replaces the **Add Package** button.
