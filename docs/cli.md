# Command Line Interface

It is possible to use the tools from the **pxt command line interface (CLI)**. ``pxt`` can:

* Edit, compile or deploy JavaScript programs.
* Easily integrate into most IDEs. It comes with built-in support for [Visual Studio Code](/code).
* Run a local web server for the web editor.
* Author extensions using JavaScript and/or C++.

Using the PXT CLI assumes that you have some experience with programming and will require installation of additional tools on your machine.
