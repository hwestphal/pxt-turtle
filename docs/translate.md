# Help translate

Translations of text in the editor, in blocks, and documentation managed by [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/kindscript), a translation management platform. It is free to join
and you can volunteer to translate parts of the web site. Translation into different languages is done by the work of people all over the world who volunteer to help MakeCode be accessible to as many people as possible.

## Localized MakeCode

Text, or [strings](/types/string), used in the editor and documentation pages are localized into the current language for the editor (you switch languages by choosing **Language** in the **Settings** menu). Text is continually being added or changed so translations are always at a different stage of completeness. MakeCode text content is stored in files on Crowdin in [English](https://crowdin.com/project/kindscript/en#). Translators choose their language in the [MakeCode Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/kindscript) and work on the files for the editor they want to translate for.

## Want to help?

Good! A description of the process and general guidance is found in the [Microsoft MakeCode translation](https://makecode.com/translate) page to help you get started.

## Crowdin files for @boardname@

The **MakeCode for @boardname@** editor uses some core translation files for it's interface, basic blocks, and documents which are common to all of the editors (they are also described in the general translation [page](https://makecode.com/translate)). There are many more string files and documents that are specific to the @boardname@ editor.
