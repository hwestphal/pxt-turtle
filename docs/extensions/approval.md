# Extension Approval

Only approved extensions are available in the search results of the ``Extensions`` dialog.
GitHub Organizations or GitHub repos can be approved.

Banned extensions are not allowed to load.

## Checklist

Whenever you are submitting an extension for approval, please check that you have completed the following tasks:

* A release has been created in GitHub. You can create a release of the extension when syncing in the MakeCode editor or using the **pxt bump** cli command.
* An icon image **icon.png** is available in the root folder. It should be 300x200 pixels and **less than 100kb** in size.
* A GitHub repo description added that's descriptive enough to help with extension search.
* A test file, called ``test.ts``, is present and compiles when running **pxt deploy**.
* The ``README.md`` file contains API documentation for the extension blocks.
