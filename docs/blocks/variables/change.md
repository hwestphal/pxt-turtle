# Change value

Change, meaning increase, the value of a variable by some amount.

```block
let x = 0
x += 2
```
The change blocks increase the value in the variable by the amount you want. This is also
known as an _addition assignment_ operation.

### Change a declared variable

Use the change operator to set a new, larger value to a [variable](/blocks/variables/var).
If you **`let`** a variable have a value of `1`, the change block makes the value change
by `2` like this:

```block
let x = 1
x += 2
```
### ~ hint
You can use the change operator with variables of each of the supported [types](/types).
