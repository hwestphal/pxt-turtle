# Assignment operator (=)

Use an equals sign to make a [variable](/blocks/variables/var) store the [number](/types/number),
[string](/types/string), or [boolean](/types/boolean) you say.

```block
let myNumber = 7
let myString = "Yellow Whirled"
let myLogic = true
```
When you use the equals sign to store something in a variable, the equals sign is called
an *assignment operator*, and what you store is called a *value*. A value can be a _literal_
value, like `20` or `"Dreaming"`. Or, a value can be another variable you want
to copy, ```let newItem = oldItem```.

Here is an example of variable assignment in code:

```typescript
let perfect = 10;
let extra = 1;
let extraPerfect = perfect + extra;
```

## ~hint

You can use the assignment operator with variables of 
every [type](/types). A *type* is which kind of thing
a variable can store, like a number or string.
