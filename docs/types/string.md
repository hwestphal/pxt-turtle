# String

A *String* is a sequence of characters. 

### #intro

A string type is more complex than a number or a boolean. Strings have a length and you can
change the characters inside the string. You can also break strings apart and make new strings, or
put strings together and make longer strings.

### Create a string variable

```block
let greeting = "Hello";
```

To create a variable that holds a string:

1. Click `Variables` (in the Block drawer).

2. Type a name for your new string variable by clicking the down arrow, then click New Variable. Then type the variable name "salutation"

3. Drag a string block on the right side of the operator.

4. Click `"Hello"` and then type a string like `hello`.

Your code should look something like this:

```block
let greeting = "Hello";
```
